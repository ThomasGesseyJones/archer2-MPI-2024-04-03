# My Notes

## Day 1 (Wednesday, 2024-04-03)

### Introduction 

Using ARCHER2, Tier-1 HPC service in the UK.
5860 nodes each with 128 cores (> 750,000 CPU cores), closest UK has to a national supercomputer.
Provided by EPCC, The University of Edinburgh.
Provide a range of postgraduate teaching (Msc in HPC) and training courses.
Including a supercomputing MOOC, good for a conceptual introduction to HPC (on ARCHER2 website).

Self-contained course, ARCHER2 is just what we are using, but the course is not specific to ARCHER2.

Instructor: David Henty ([d.henty@epcc.ed.ac.uk](mailto:d.henty@epcc.ed.ac.uk))

Course Website: [https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/courses/240403-mpi/](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/courses/240403-mpi/)

Personal accounts for duration of the course, will lose access after a month, and then delete after another two weeks.
Remember to back up!

Getting time on ARCHER2, can apply for time, or take the ARCHER2 Driving Test, for a free allocation of 800CU 
(1 CU = 1 node hour) every 12 months! Roughly 100,000 CPU hours. Applying for time is peer-reviewed process like on 
DIRAC.
